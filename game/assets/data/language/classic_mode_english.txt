"Classic Mode" was basically a special night that would be a full 
homage to the 2021 TRTF REBUILT. In theory, it was a reskin of the gameplay. 
ShotOfRabbet made all the models for these recreations of the original models. 
Due to time and practicality, it was ultimately scrapped 
(also because it was unnecessary to include something that wouldn't add much to the game).

These models were also released on the game's official website 
so anyone can have fun with them!
