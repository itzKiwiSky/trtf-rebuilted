We originally planned to include "partial free roam" sections after each night. 
It was later scrapped, and we later repurposed it for use only in the endgame, 
while also adding a video camera where the protagonist would record what he sees. 
This was ultimately scrapped due to time constraints and because 
it felt unnecessary for a game of this magnitude.
