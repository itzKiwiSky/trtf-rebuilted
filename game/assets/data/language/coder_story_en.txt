This is me, I'm was another coder contacted by ElEternaut to help they create this game.
The first version has been done in almost 2 months, even when my pc almost exploded due battery leak. 
The game was working really well and was close to run a closed beta test, until 
something happen. The old version of the engine didn't have support for screen scale, so on monitor above 1920x1080
resolution, the game will broke totally. I had to give up the development specially due school stuff.
But now, secretly called as "Plan K" by Eternaut, we finish this project.
